# Screen a declared set of conversion comparisons

Use this code unchanged. Before seeing outcomes, select one defensible
non-identifying dimension and at most eight categories. Each
comparison is one category against the rest of the same eligible funnel cohort,
using one independent actor per row and the dimension on its first step. Missing
dimensions and ambiguous first-step values remain explicit; never use arbitrary
`any()` attribution. Do not compare overlapping actors as independent samples.

Use a two-sided Fisher exact test (probability ordering), then Holm correction
across **all** declared category comparisons, including unavailable comparisons
as p=1. Report at most the strongest surviving difference, its denominators,
absolute percentage-point difference, p-value, adjusted p-value and test name.
Require at least 20 actors in each arm before interpretation. This is descriptive
screening, not causality or a guarantee that a small sample has sufficient power.
If none passes, say "No supported breakdown". Never choose a new family after
seeing the results. Large exact-test support is deliberately bounded; report it
as unavailable instead of substituting an unreviewed approximation.
