# Contributed workflow packages

This folder accepts deterministic Python, Python with managed model steps, and Codex
procedures. They use the same versioned package format as project-owned workflows.
CI validates every package without executing its Python, prompts or skills.

Start with code when you know the steps. Add model calls where judgment is useful. Use a
procedure when an agent needs to choose the steps. [Adding a workflow](../docs/adding-a-workflow.md)
covers authoring, tests and the maintainer-controlled public Registry registration.

## Code examples

- [CSV summary](example.csv_summary/workflow.json): deterministic parsing, validation and totals.
- [Feedback digest](example.feedback_digest/workflow.json): two managed model steps, with
  Python validation between classification and summarization.

Each directory contains a manifest and `main.py`. Copy one, change its folder and manifest
key together, and declare every file in `code.files`. Code packages accept `.py`, `.csv`,
`.json`, `.md`, `.txt`, `.yaml` and `.yml`; shell scripts and binary resources are not accepted.
The entrypoint exports `run(ctx, inputs)` and returns the declared path and text content.
The examples' offline tests live in [test_public_workflows.py](../tests/test_public_workflows.py).
They are copyable source examples, not active Registry entries.

See [code workflows](../docs/code-workflows.md) and
[managed model steps](../docs/code-model-workflows.md) for runtime and funding limits.

## Codex procedure example

[PostHog funnel](example.posthog_funnel/workflow.json) is a complete connection example:
a bounded procedure uses `procedure.services` and a project-owned custom API key through
Tin's gateway. It is not registered or live-qualified. See [API connections](../docs/project-api-connections.md)
for secure setup, permissions, limits and evaluation requirements.
Its [HogQL resource](example.posthog_funnel/skills/posthog-funnel/HOGQL.md) supplies a reusable
ordered funnel calculation and aggregate validator. It has explicit actor/attempt semantics;
it does not infer instrumentation or qualify a complete analytics product. Offline regression
checks are in [test_posthog_funnel.py](../tests/test_posthog_funnel.py); real provider evaluation
remains separately authorized.
The [synthetic SQL fixture](../tests/fixtures/posthog_funnel/ordered.sql) and its paired response
preserve a provider-dialect regression case for ties, duplicates, mixed attempts, missing steps
and exact medians. CI checks the generated query against that baseline without contacting PostHog.

Use this shape when the workflow needs a bounded agent run. Private trials of procedure
packages remain manual, not scheduled.

```text
workflow_packages/<your.workflow_key>/
├── workflow.json    the contract: inputs, output, which skill to start from
├── PROMPT.md        what the run is asked to do, and what it must not do
└── skills/
    └── <entry-skill>/
        └── SKILL.md the method, in the ordinary skill format
```

The key uses a family and a name, like `growth.reddit_teardown`. The folder name and the `key`
in the manifest have to match. A skill's `name` has to match its own folder name.

Skills may carry extra text beside `SKILL.md`, as `.md`, `.json`, `.txt`, `.yaml` or `.yml`.
List every one of them in `skill_files`. Procedure packages are text-only; unlike code
packages, they do not carry `.py`. Neither package type accepts `.sh`.

### The manifest

This one validates. Copy it and change the parts that describe your workflow.

```json
{
  "package_format": "tin-workflow-package-v1",
  "definition": {
    "key": "growth.example_play",
    "title": "Name the workflow the way a founder would say it",
    "description": "One sentence: who runs this, and what they have at the end.",
    "executor": "codex.procedure",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "schedule_modes": ["on_demand"],
    "input_schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "additionalProperties": false,
      "required": ["project_id"],
      "properties": {
        "project_id": { "type": "string", "format": "uuid" },
        "focus": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "What to look at",
          "maxLength": 2000,
          "default": "",
          "x-tin-ui": { "control": "textarea", "order": 10 }
        }
      }
    },
    "procedure": {
      "prompt_path": "PROMPT.md",
      "skills_path": "skills",
      "skill_files": ["skills/example-play/SKILL.md"],
      "entry_skill": "example-play",
      "workspace": { "kind": "project.state" },
      "sandbox": { "profile": "isolated", "egress": "fenced", "timeout_seconds": 900 },
      "output": {
        "kind": "project.artifact",
        "path": "reports/EXAMPLE_PLAY.md",
        "media_type": "text/markdown",
        "max_bytes": 250000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Every text input needs a `maxLength`, every array a `maxItems`, and `project_id` stays as it is.
A package declares one output: either a file in the project, as above, or a GitHub pull request.

For a complete minimal example, save this as `PROMPT.md`:

```markdown
Read the project context and the optional focus input. Follow the example-play skill and
write reports/EXAMPLE_PLAY.md. Do not publish, send messages or change other files.
```

Save this as `skills/example-play/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: example-play
description: Identify one useful next action from existing project evidence.
---

Read relevant project files. Recommend one concrete next action, cite the project paths
that support it, and distinguish evidence from assumptions. If context is insufficient,
explain what is missing instead of inventing facts. Write only the declared report.
```

## Check your work

```bash
uv python install 3.12
uv sync --frozen
uv run tin-lite validate-community
```

It names the package, the check that failed and where to fix it. CI runs the same command on
your pull request. `--root /path/to/checkout` selects another checkout (not its package folder).
Missing manifests, symlinks and invalid roots fail the check; a README-only folder passes.
Validation checks the contract and resources, not the quality or safety of executing instructions.

## Try the procedure example on a project

Use a project you are authorized to test. Ask its coding agent for
`get_workflow_authoring_guide(project_id)` first: private execution must be operator-enabled.
Normal run billing and integration requirements still apply; validation and activation do not
purchase a model run.

1. Copy the three example files into a **project-local copy** under
   `workflow_packages/custom.example_play/`. Change the manifest key to `custom.example_play`
   to match that folder. Keep `on_demand` and the explicit isolated, fenced sandbox above.
   Leave the contributed source package unchanged.
2. Use `list_project_files` and `commit_project_changes` through MCP to save the copy in project
   Files against the current project revision. Keep the returned commit SHA.
3. Call `validate_workflow_package(project_id, path, revision)` with
   `path: workflow_packages/custom.example_play/workflow.json` and that exact SHA. Resolve
   diagnostics before continuing. Other contributions may need further adaptations to meet
   [private activation policy](../docs/private-workflow-activation.md); a passing contribution
   check alone does not guarantee private activation.
4. Explicitly call `activate_workflow_package` with the same project, path and revision,
   a fresh UUID `request_id`, and `expected_revision: null` for a new workflow. For updates,
   use its currently activated revision instead. Activation does **not** run the workflow.
5. Inspect the returned workflow using `get_workflow`, then explicitly `start_workflow` if you
   want to execute it. Read `reports/EXAMPLE_PLAY.md` from the resulting run. Review the actual
   output before recommending the package; successful validation is not an execution test.

This private test is optional; it isn't the public registration process.

## What we look for

A workflow a founder would want to run, rather than a summary of marketing advice. Say where
the insight came from. If you ran it yourself, say what happened.

## What happens next

A maintainer reviews the implementation, inputs, outputs, tests, cost bounds and permissions.
Adding the key and a stable UUID to `PUBLIC_WORKFLOWS` in
[public_workflows.py](../src/tin_lite/public_workflows.py) selects it for the next deployed
catalog sync. That publishes the exact manifest and resources together for both dashboard
and MCP. No new executor or copy of the implementation is needed.

Merging an unlisted package only adds its source. It does not activate, schedule or run it.
The included `example.*` packages are intentionally unlisted. Existing runs and saved
configurations keep their selected revision when a package is upgraded.
