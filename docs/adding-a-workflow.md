# Adding a workflow

A workflow is a job you want to run again. You give it inputs, decide how the work happens,
and define what should come out. Tin handles running it, saving the result, and making it
available through the dashboard and MCP.

Start with code. If a step needs judgment, call a model from that code. If the job needs an
agent to explore and decide what to do along the way, use a Codex procedure. All three can
be contributed to the public Registry; they aren't three different products.

## Choose how the work happens

### Ordinary Python

Use `workflow.code` when you know the steps: parse a file, filter records, calculate something,
validate it, write a report. There's no reason to ask a model to do arithmetic your code can do.

A package is a small directory:

```text
workflow_packages/reports.your_summary/
├── workflow.json
└── main.py
```

`workflow.json` declares the inputs, entrypoint, files, runtime limit and output.
`main.py` exports `run(ctx, inputs)`, which returns `{"path": "...", "content": "..."}`.
It can be synchronous or asynchronous. Every helper or data file must be declared too.

Start from [the CSV summary](../workflow_packages/example.csv_summary/workflow.json) and
its [Python implementation](../workflow_packages/example.csv_summary/main.py). It validates
the supplied rows and totals an integer column. No model, prompt or skill file is involved.

### Python with model steps

Use the same executor when some steps need a model. Your code still owns the sequence,
branches, loops, validation and rendering. A workflow can have several model steps; it
doesn't have to hand the whole job to an agent.

Declare each route under `code.model_routes`, including its provider, model and call limits.
Then call it where you need it:

```python
classified = await ctx.models.generate(
    route="classify",
    step="classify_feedback",
    instructions="Classify each supplied feedback item. Preserve its ID.",
    data=items,
    output_schema=CLASSIFICATION_SCHEMA,
)
# Validate classified["parsed"], then pass the checked result to another step.
```

The [feedback digest](../workflow_packages/example.feedback_digest/main.py) shows the complete
sequence: assign IDs in code, classify with a model, check that no IDs changed, summarize
with a second model call, then render the report. Its
[manifest](../workflow_packages/example.feedback_digest/workflow.json) declares both calls.

Keep `step` stable for each logical call. Tin records completed calls and reuses their
results if execution retries. Changing the request under an already-used step ID is an
error, not permission to buy another response. Code itself may run again, so don't treat
a local variable or scratch file as durable state.

Tin supplies the model service. Hosted calls use Tin-managed credentials and credits;
self-hosted calls use the operator's configured credentials. Don't put provider keys in
the package. Declared limits feed the existing estimate, and verified usage is charged.
Code-only bounded execution uses no Tin credits.

### Codex procedures

Use `codex.procedure` when choosing the steps is part of the job: investigating a question,
working through an unfamiliar repository, or drafting from project evidence. The package
contains `workflow.json`, `PROMPT.md` and `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, rather than a Python
entrypoint. The contract still bounds the inputs, workspace, integrations and output.

The [package guide](../workflow_packages/README.md#codex-procedure-example) has a copyable
example. Procedure packages can produce a project artifact or an unmerged GitHub PR.
They don't acquire the interactive conversation and controls of a one-off `project.task`.

## Submit it

For a new or revised package, follow [creation and qualification](workflow-qualification.md):
keep a small versioned case file outside the package, test behavior offline, and distinguish
author claims from measured live quality and cost. Tin's creator uses the same checks as
hand-authored contributions. Existing packages can adopt the case file incrementally.

Put the package under `workflow_packages/<key>/`, with the same key in the manifest.
Use a descriptive key such as `reports.customer_digest`; reserve `example.*` for examples
and `custom.*` for project-local copies. Include offline tests under `tests/`: a useful input,
the expected result, invalid inputs, and any model or integration responses as fixtures.
Show what happens when a model returns a plausible but unusable result.

Run the static package check and your tests:

```bash
uv sync --frozen
uv run tin-lite validate-community
uv run pytest tests/test_your_workflow.py
```

Validation reads the manifest and declared resources. It parses Python but doesn't execute
it. Your tests execute code separately, without production credentials or paid API calls.
A passing validator proves the package fits the contract, not that its output is useful.

In the PR, explain who would run this, what they get, why an existing workflow doesn't
cover it, and how you tested it. Name the integrations, model costs and any external effects.
External contributions need passing CI and maintainer review; see [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## From a package to the public Registry

A maintainer explicitly adds the reviewed package's key and a permanent UUID to
`PUBLIC_WORKFLOWS` in [public_workflows.py](../src/tin_lite/public_workflows.py):

```python
PublicWorkflow(UUID("bced29da-7c99-45a2-8f59-f5c0964d3b51"), "reports.customer_digest")
```

Generate a new UUID for your entry; don't reuse this example. This registration can be
reviewed in the same PR or follow a source-only contribution. Don't copy the implementation
into the native catalog or write another executor for it.

The next deployed catalog sync validates the selection, publishes the manifest and all its
resources together, and updates the public Registry projection. The dashboard and MCP read
that same catalog. Existing runs and saved configurations keep their pinned version.
Keep published IDs, keys, executor and source paths stable.

Merging source alone doesn't activate a package. The shipped `example.*` packages are
deliberately unregistered, so they won't appear as customer workflows. Removing a registration
also isn't an archival command for an already-published workflow.

## Know the current boundary

The code package runtime is Python 3.12.8 with the standard library, up to 60 seconds and
one declared text artifact. It supports up to eight managed model calls across four routes;
only the registered OpenAI Luna and Astra routes are currently admitted. There is no `pip`
installation, raw credential injection or direct network access. Use declared
[project service bindings](project-api-connections.md) for supported external requests.
See [code execution](code-workflows.md) and [model steps](code-model-workflows.md) for exact bounds.

If the workflow needs longer durable orchestration, multiple distinct activities, or a
capability outside this contract, contribute a native implementation. The existing catalog
already contains code-defined and model-backed workflows. Native changes explicitly register
the definition in `catalog.py`, the Temporal implementation in `workflows.py`, and activities
in the worker. Keep I/O in activities, payloads out of Temporal history, and test retries,
billing and artifact publication. Discuss that larger change in an issue first.

Public and private describe who can use a workflow, not how it runs. You can try a package
as a `custom.*` copy in an operator-enabled project using the existing
[validate/activate flow](private-workflow-activation.md). Public Registry registration doesn't
need that private-project allowlist. Schedules and review remain properties of the definition;
private Codex procedures are still on demand. Project-owned writing guides and other skills
remain in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in project Files.
